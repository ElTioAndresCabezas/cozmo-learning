# Cubetest
This program connects Cozmo to it's cubes, makes them light up, and asks you to tap all of them<br>
This program is based heavily on one of Cozmo's SDK Examples program. (./tutorials/05_async_python/01_cube_blinker_sync.py)

A video demonstration of the program can be found here: https://youtu.be/CblEMTRAAkM
